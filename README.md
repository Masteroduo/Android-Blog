### Few Questions you might have

#### 1. Why did I choose Android instead of IOS?

Few Reasons, I have used IOS in the past and I loved it but I'm someone who likes tinkering with electronics, shit like chaging ROMS, Rooting, Tricking mega corporations into giving me stuff for free üòà, Modding etc. However IOS makes it outright impossible to do stuff like these. The main reason why I didnt choose IOS is because it's too locked down for me.

#### 2. What Phone do I use and Why did I choose it?

I use Redmi Note 9 Pro Global version(Joyeuse) and I bought it because my clown ass brain didnt wait 3 more days for Note 10 Pro to release because Im a clown ü§°.

#### 3. What do you think of Aren? üêñüêñ

I hate him with every cell in my body and I think he should not exist because he is a oinky oinky from Mumbai Sewers and He does stupid shit because he is a üê∑üê∑üê∑

#### 4. Why do I use Custom ROM instead of Stock ROM aka MEMEUI

So when I bought this phone I never had intentions of flashing customs on it. I was really happy with MIUI Android 10 version and I liked to use Lawnchair Launcher instead of MIUI launcher because MIUI launcher is dog shit. Anyway I made a mistake of updating to MIUI A11 and it all went downhill from there, I was unable to use Gestures with third party launchers cause Google and Xiaomi Broke it and they refused to fix it. I basically gave up on MIUI and applied for a bootloader unlock process the next week itself. 

### My Tools of Trade

ROM: SparkOS

Phone: Redmi Note 9 Pro

RAM: 6GB

ROM(kek): 128GB

### ROM Journey

So my first ROM LineageOS and It was an epic ROM but it lacked customisation and It was A11 and other ROMS where shipping with A12 so I flashed Derpfest and it was an awesome ROM at the beginning but the Maintainer messed it up thru updates and tree changes and now the battery on it sucks shit so I changed to Project Arcana which was an Awesome ROM but that too faced the same fate as Derpfest and kept on becoming shit through updates and then the main developer developer decided to stop maintaining Arcana and that was the end of that ROM. Then I hopped on to Nusantara Project but the Dev of that ROM has been known to have done sussy shit in the past so I ditched that rom as well. Then I AOSP extended, ForkLineageOS, and CRDroid. All of them were shit until I found SparkOS which was the best ROM I found till now

So I'm currently on Rooted SparkOS with Magisk 25.5.
