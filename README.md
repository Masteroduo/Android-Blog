### Few Questions you might have

#### 1. Why did I choose Android instead of IOS?

Few Reasons, I have used IOS in the past and I loved it but I'm someone who likes tinkering with electronics, shit like chaging ROMS, Rooting, Tricking mega corporations into giving me stuff for free, Modding etc. However IOS makes it outright impossible to do stuff like these. The main reason why I didnt choose IOS is because it's too locked down for me.

#### 2. What Phone do I use and Why did I choose it?

I use Redmi Note 9 Pro Global version(Joyeuse) version.

#### 3. Why do I use Custom ROM instead of Stock ROM aka MEMEUI

So when I bought this phone I never had intentions of flashing customs on it. I was really happy with MIUI Android 10 version and I liked to use Lawnchair Launcher instead of MIUI launcher because MIUI launcher is bad. Anyway I made a mistake of updating to MIUI A11 and it all went downhill from there, I was unable to use Gestures with third party launchers cause Google and Xiaomi Broke it and they refused to fix it. I basically gave up on MIUI and applied for a bootloader unlock process the next week itself.

### ROM Journey

So my first ROM LineageOS and It was an epic ROM but it lacked customisation and It was A11 and other ROMS where shipping with A12 so I flashed Derpfest and it was an awesome ROM at the beginning but the Maintainer messed it up thru updates and tree changes and now the battery on it horrible so I changed to Project Arcana which was an Awesome ROM but that too faced the same fate as Derpfest and kept on becoming worse through updates and then the main developer developer decided to stop maintaining Arcana and that was the end of that ROM. Then I hopped on to Nusantara Project but the Dev of that ROM has been known to have done suspicious stuff in the past so I ditched that rom as well. Then I switched to AOSP extended, ForkLineageOS, and CRDroid. All of them were subpar until I found SparkOS which was the best ROM I found till now

So I'm currently on Rooted SparkOS with Magisk 25.5.

### Some important apps I use

[Swift Backup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.swiftapps.swiftbackup&hl=en&gl=US) - Useful for backup and restore when I'm changing ROMS(Root Required)

[Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) - For Rooting my device. I always stay on the latest version of Magisk

[Gcam](https://www.celsoazevedo.com/files/android/google-camera/dev-bsg/) - I use the one by BSG because it supports Monet themeing and It supports all the lens on my device without any config files

[Youtube Vanced(RIP)](https://t.me/AyraProject/1422) -  Modified version of Youtube with no Ads and Background play for Free

[Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord) - Open Source Modded Version of Discord with many plugins

[QuickSwitch](https://t.me/QuickstepSwitcherReleases) - Allows me to Bypass Google's rule of not allowing Gestures on third party Launchers(Root Required)

[Lawnchair Launcher](https://t.me/lawnchairci) - A very good Launcher with which I cannot live without, comes with all sorts of gimmicks and functionalities which can't be found in other launchers like per app customisation, Monet themeing,

### Magisk Modules I use 

[Sonals ANX Camera](https://www.pling.com/p/1730136/) - Basically Sonal Singh's(Pro dev btw) port of MIUI camera for AOSP ROMS

[IOS 15.4 Emojis](https://t.me/fileschat/211278) - I use IOS emojis cause it looks better than Google's Emoji IN MY OPINION

[Kdrag0n's Universal Safetynet Fix](https://github.com/kdrag0n/safetynet-fix/) - I need this or otherwise Netflix wont stop bothering about not being able to Install

[NoStorageRestrict](https://github.com/DanGLES3/NoStorageRestrict) - Helps me to bypass Google's rule of not being to choose the Download's folder

### 29/06/2022 - Time for a Rom Hop?

It seems like the battery life on SparkOS has been becoming worse and unstable as time goes on. This is more apparent in the Screen off Drain which is bad. The active Drain is also bad but it sometimes decides to be 4-5%/h but other times it goes above 8%/h which is not good. Been thinking of changing ROMS but kinda lazy rn cause I have everything setup in SparkOS and changing ROMs means transfering, backup and all those stuff. So far the ROM I have in my mind are Project Blaze, PixysOS, VoltageOS and CherishOS. However this time I want to try out the vanilla build with Gapps to get rid of the unwanted google bloatware like Assistant etc.

### 17/07/2022 Perfect ROM finally found?

Taken from my last edit "so far the ROM I have in my mind are Project Blaze, PixysOS, VoltageOS and CherishOS". 

So that was a lie. I Ended up choosing Ricedroid 3.0 By Skorpion and honestly the first few days the idle was bad and a very helpful person on Telegram pointed to me that you had to turn off "Pocket Mode" to get better Deepsleep. It was only then I realized that pocket mode caused Deepsleep issues and after I disabled it my idle drain and Deep sleep improved soo much. I highly recommend this ROM to anyone on Miatoll and is intrested in A12.1 Roms then I can recommend this ROM. Link to the ROM - https://www.pling.com/p/1849966/

### 28/05/2023 Back to MEMEUI

Due to issues with Banking Apps and battery and Video Quality on Gcam, I have gone back to MIUI although the EU version and not the Global Version. Device is no longer rooted anymore due to banking issues, Personally I miss AOSP ROMS but this works for me and is stable enough for day to day usage. I get an average SOT of 6 hours. I hate MIUI but I have no other choice as life is busy and I can't keep shifting ROMS like i used to do. MIUI doesnt have Monet themeing, its stil stuck on A12. I'm just gonna stick with this as it works for me so far.

### 20/06/2023 "Final Thoughts: The Journey's End"

Me being an hardcore android fan for solid 12 years, This story has come to an end. I have recently acquired an Iphone 12 Pro and with that it puts an end to my custom ROM and Modding journey, it has been fun and educating, learning stuff like how to unlock your bootloader, how to install custom recoveries, Rooting and subsequent trying to play rat and mice with banking apps. This blog will no longer be updated as modding is not possible much on iphone. it has been a fun journey with that this blog comes to an end, Goodbye - Masteroduo
